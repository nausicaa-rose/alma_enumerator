It can handle the basic pattern "v 10 no 1 Mar 2 2015"
with all fields being treated as optional, although there 
must be at least a volume or year it can handle the pattern 
"v 10 no 1 2 Mar 2015" with the same rules as above, except 
when there day is recorded but not the second level of 
enumeration. That is, "no. 1 2 Mar 2015" will be treated as 
if the first number is the volume number and the second, which
represents March 2, will be treated as the issue number.
